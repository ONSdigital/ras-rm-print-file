# TODO 

1. Permission to upload to the bucket - is it manually added in preprod at the minute? I can't find the terraform scripts.
2. Create a google cloud firestore service and wire it in
3. Implement code in store.go to upload to firestore
4. Implement back off retry mechanism
5. Add missing unit tests
